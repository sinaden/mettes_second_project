The official template for Medical AI Datasheets.

*v0.2-alpha*

MAIDS is currently being prototyped for the [Copenhagen Ultrathon on Precision Medicine](https://ultrathon.online) where you will find several examples.

This repository is intended to maintain the code and protocols for authoring new MAIDS documents based on the MAIDS specification ([maintained separately](https://github.com/PERSIMUNE-Health-Informatics/MAIDS-Specification)). The specification is included as a submodule ensuring proper tracking of provenance when forking this repo to create new MAIDS documents.

You can make use of this template either through the Github templating button at the top of this page or by cloning and changing the remote to your organisation or own account. Templating makes it quick and easy to get started but you will not be able to merge any updates using git. Cloning, on the other hand, will allow you to use git to update provided you know how. We plan to make updating easier in the future, but for now these are your only options. Please do not fork this repository unless you would actually like to contribute directly to this project.

Please watch/star if you'd like to be notified of new developments.
