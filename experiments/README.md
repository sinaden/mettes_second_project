# Experiments

This is a working directory for data consumers (analysts, etc.) to work with the dataset described. Use it to keep track of your code, results (outputs), and reports. The MAIDS specification does suggest a format for this folder and you are free to use any structure you like. 

The only recommendation is to use `./synthetic/` in your code to input data. This will ensure easy migration once the actual dataset is made available.

If working in a team you may wish to create named folders with `code/` `reports/` and `results/` as subfolders.
