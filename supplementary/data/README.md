# Data

Location for arbitrary data that might enhance the value of this descriptive document. And data deposited here should be referenced and explained in the descriptive documents to ensure their utlility.

Pregenerated synthetic data should be placed here and not in `./synthetic/` as that root directory is reserved for the models and code located in `./code/build_synthetic`.

This location is not meant to handle large datasets. MAIDS descriptions are not designed to transmit raw data but to communicate their meaning and intent.
